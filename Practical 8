Practical No. 08 – Interactive Dashboards

Aim: Learn considerations for dashboard creation, place multiple charts, add titles/navigation/buttons/actions to make dashboards interactive.

1. Open Tableau & Connect Data

Open Tableau Public.

Connect to the Lung Cancer dataset.

How to Perform:

On the Start Page → under Connect, click Microsoft Excel/CSV (depending on your dataset format).

Select your file and click Open.

2. Create a Bar Chart (Alcohol Consumption vs Lung Cancer)

Drag Alcohol Consuming → Columns.

Drag Number of Records (count of dataset) → Rows.

Drag Lung Cancer → Color.

How to Perform:

This creates a grouped bar chart showing how alcohol consumption relates to lung cancer, with bars colored by cancer status.

3. Create Doughnut Chart for Lung Cancer

Create a new sheet.

Create a Dummy field:

Right-click Data Pane → Create Calculated Field → type 0 → name it Dummy.

Drag Dummy twice into Rows.

Right-click the second axis → select Dual Axis.

Format chart using Lung Cancer dimension and dataset count.

How to Perform:

The Dual Axis trick makes two concentric circles → after formatting inner circle smaller, it becomes a doughnut chart.

Assign Lung Cancer to Color to show categories.

4. Create Doughnut Chart for Chest Pain

Create another new sheet.

Repeat the Dummy field trick (two Dummy fields in Rows → Dual Axis).

Use Chest Pain dimension + dataset count to format the doughnut chart.

How to Perform:

Same process as step 3, but here doughnut represents chest pain categories instead of lung cancer.

5. Create Histogram for Age

Create another new sheet.

Drag Age → Rows.

Go to Show Me → select Histogram.

How to Perform:

Tableau automatically bins Age into intervals (e.g., 20–30, 30–40, etc.).

Histogram shows frequency of patients in each age range.

6. Create Bubble Chart for Gender

Create a new sheet.

Drag Gender → Columns.

Drag Number of Records (count) → Size (Marks card).

Change Marks → Circle.

How to Perform:

Each gender is represented by a bubble.

Bubble size shows the number of records for each gender.

7. Create the Dashboard

Click New Dashboard icon (bottom tab next to sheets).

In Dashboard Pane, set device type (Desktop, Tablet, Phone) and adjust width/height.

How to Perform:

This opens a blank dashboard canvas where you can place multiple charts together.

8. Add Dashboard Title

From Objects (left panel), drag Text → place at top.

Type “Lung Cancer Analysis” → format (font, size, alignment).

How to Perform:

You can style it like a report heading (bold, bigger font).

9. Insert Sheets into Dashboard

From Sheets section (left panel), drag Bar Chart, Doughnut Charts, Histogram, and Bubble Chart into dashboard.

Arrange them properly.

How to Perform:

You can resize and reposition each visualization like tiles in a layout.

Use floating option if you want charts to overlap or place freely.

10. Format Dashboard

Go to Format → Dashboard from top menu.

Apply background color, grid lines, borders if needed.

Save the dashboard.

How to Perform:

This makes the dashboard look clean and presentation-ready.

Save using File → Save to Tableau Public (if logged in) or Save As → .twbx.

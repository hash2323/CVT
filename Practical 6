Practical No. 06 – Maps in Tableau

Aim: Create Symbol, Filled, and Density Maps, add layers and pie charts, use Viz in Tooltip, explore map services, and analyze spatial data.

A) Symbol Map

Steps:

Drag the Country dimension into Columns or Rows shelf.

Go to Show Me panel → select Symbol Map.

In the Marks card, set mark type as Shape.

Drag the Profit measure to Size.

Click on Shape in Marks card to change symbols.

How to Perform:

After dragging Country, Tableau automatically generates latitude and longitude.

When you choose Symbol Map, dots will appear for each country.

Dragging Profit → Size makes the dots bigger or smaller depending on profit.

Click Shape icon (in Marks card) to pick custom shapes (circles, squares, stars, etc.).

B) Filled Map

Steps:

Drag the Country dimension to the view.

In Show Me, select Maps.

In Marks card, change mark type to Map.

Drag Profit measure to Color.

Add Country dimension to Label.

How to Perform:

Tableau will shade each country.

Darker/lighter colors indicate higher/lower profit.

Adding Country to Label shows the country names on map.

C) Density Map

Steps:

Drag the Country field to the view.

Change the Marks type to Density.

Drag Profit measure to Color.

How to Perform:

Density maps highlight areas with higher concentration of data.

When you drop Profit on Color, areas with higher profit show brighter or more intense color.

D) Adding Map Layers

Steps:

In an existing Symbol Map → go to Map tab in the top ribbon.

Select Background Layers.

In the Background Map Layers pane, add styles (e.g., Streets, Satellite, Dark, etc.).

How to Perform:

You can overlay extra information (terrain, streets, coastline).

Each map style can be toggled from the side panel.

E) Adding Pie Charts on Maps

Steps:

Create a Symbol Map with Country dimension.

In Marks card, change mark type to Pie.

Drag Profit measure to Size.

Drag Category dimension to Color.

Drag Country to Label.

How to Perform:

Each country location becomes a pie chart.

The pie size is based on Profit.

The slices represent different product Categories.

F) Using Viz in Tooltip

Steps:

Create a bar chart showing Profit by Category.

Open the Symbol Map sheet.

Click on Tooltip (Marks card → Label → Tooltip button).

Click Insert → Sheets → select the bar chart sheet.

How to Perform:

When you hover over a country in the Symbol Map, a small bar chart appears inside the tooltip.

This adds extra details without cluttering the main map.

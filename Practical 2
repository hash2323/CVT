Practical No. 02 – Adding Data Sources

Aim: Work with multiple data sources – joins, unions, metadata, hierarchies, calculated fields, optimization.

Steps with “How to Perform”:
A) Set up Connectors

Open Tableau Public → On Start Page, under Connect, click Microsoft Excel.

Select your dataset Excel file and click Open.

B) Selecting Tables

Once dataset is loaded, Tableau shows all available tables (sheet names).

Click on a table name → preview its data appears below.

C) Performing Joins/Unions

Drag one table (e.g., Returns) on top of another (e.g., Orders) in the canvas area.

Tableau shows a Join icon (two overlapping circles).

Click the icon → choose Join Type (Inner, Left, Right, Full) and Join Field (common column).

D) Edit Metadata

Go to Data Source tab.

Right-click Order Date → select Rename → type Date of Order.

Click data type icon next to Row ID → change from Number (whole) to Number (decimal).

Right-click Ship Mode → select Aliases → change Standard Class to High Class.

E) Add Hierarchies / Calculated Fields

Hierarchy:
a) In the Data Pane, drag Category field over Sub-Category.
b) Tableau asks to create hierarchy → name it Product Category.
c) Drag Product Category to Rows → drag Sales to Columns → expand to see both.

Calculated Field:
a) In the Data Pane → Right-click → select Create Calculated Field.
b) Name it Profit Ratio.
c) Formula: [Profit] / [Sales].
d) Drag Profit Ratio to Rows and Sub-Category to Columns → see visualization.

F) Optimize Performance

Right-click a field (e.g., Profit) → select Show Filter.

Use filters to reduce unnecessary data and speed up analysis.
